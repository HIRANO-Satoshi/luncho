** Luncho client libraries

- A client library includes a hand written API core (luncho.py, luncho.ts and so on), a hand written
  README.org, and auto-generated files by OpenAPI generator including lunchoApi.py (and so on).
- The auto-genrated files include README.md. Read both README.org and README.md before use.

- Use the luncho.py (or another in your language) rather than lunchoApi.py, because luncho.py
  provides functions for data conversion and data fetch which you will need. The functions are fast
  with caches of data.

- See README.org files in sub directories for usage and more detail.
  - [[luncho_python/README.org]]
  - [[luncho_typescript-aurelia/README.org]]
  - luncho_typescript-fetch exists but not tested at all.
