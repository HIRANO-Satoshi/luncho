      <h4>Luncho shows the same value in every country
      </h4>

      <p>
        Luncho is a common value index among currencies. A luncho value shows the same value in any
        country taking its price levels into account. For example, with 100 Luncho, you can have simple lunch
        in India, in Brazil, in USA, in Japan, and in any other countries.</p>

      <p>In India 100 Luncho is equivalent to 160 rupee ($2.19 US dollar), while the same 100 Luncho
        is equivalent to 17 real ($3.12 US dollar) in Brazil. In USA, 100 Luncho is about $7.21 US
        dollar. All are the same value because everything is just 100 Luncho.</p>

      <h4 class="">The inequality problem</h4>

      <p>
        Among many causes of the economic inequality problem, Luncho will contribute to overcome two major problems. One is the rapid progress of information technology (IT) that is enlarging the gap between people who are utilizing IT and the rest. People living in developing countries cannot buy advanced digital services because of their high prices. The other is decreasing worker's share.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>Solution and example</h4>

      <p>
        To solve to the IT gap, for example, anyone must have access to the latest digital services
        for commerce, productivity, life, entertainment and so on at affordable prices. We know
        people working on the digital services want to provide their services at appropriate prices
        in countries, but we have not had a good measure to do so. That's the reason why we should
        use the common unit of pricing that has the same value in any country.
      </p>

      <p>Luncho is a common value index among currencies made for that. A luncho value shows the
        same value in every country taking its price levels into account. Because it doesn't depend on a
        specific currency, it's neutral and fair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose you are selling a digital service for $7 per month per user. That is good for people
        in advanced countries, but too expensive for people in other countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        In such case you can sell your product at 100 Luncho or around it. You can show one of the following examples to a visitor according to the location of the visitor. It shows a local price, the same 100 Luncho, and a price in US dollar.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In USA</dt>
        <dd>Product A:  $7.12 per month, (100 Luncho)</dd>
        <dt>In India</dt>
        <dd>Product A:   157.51 rupee per month (100 Luncho, $2.14 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Finland</dt>
        <dd>Product A:  â‚¬6.08 euro per month (100 Luncho, $7.35 USD)</dd>
      </dl>

      <h4>Grow your business with Luncho</h4>
      <p>
        Once you use Luncho in your pricing page, people in developing countries who are not able to
        buy your digital service will become to afford to buy it. Luncho will accelerate growth of
        your user base and your revenue beyond the current ones without Luncho.

      <h4>How it works?</h4>

      <b>100 Luncho is 5 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR">SDR </a> and
        a Luncho value in a country is calculated into the local currency of the country using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/faq.htm#q4d">implied Purchase Power Parity (PPP)</a>, and exchange rates.</b>

      <p>
      local_currency_value = luncho_value * PPP * (SDR_per_Luncho / SDR_per_Dollar)
      </p>

      where
      <ul>
        <li>SDR_per_Luncho = 5.</li>
        <li>PPP = Country's implied Purchase Power Parity (PPP) value of this year</li>
        <li>SDR_per_Dollar = Today's exchange rate of IMF's Special Drawing Right (SDR) per US
          dollar</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can see actual calculation <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HIRANO-Satoshi/luncho/blob/master/luncho_python/luncho_python/api/luncho.py#L41">here</a> in a client library and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HIRANO-Satoshi/luncho/blob/master/server/src/ppp_data.py#L187">here</a> in the server code.</p>

      <p>
        A PPP is a theoretical exchange rate that reflects the price level of a country against
        another country, that is, how expensive goods and services are in the country. Our PPP
        data is from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp">the
        latest International Comparison Program (ICP)</a> lead by the World Bank. The ICP investigates price levels of <a target="_blank" href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33623/9781464815300.pdf">many
        items such as bread, pork, cheese, sugar, gas, medical services, cars, etc</a> in each
        country every five years. So, Luncho reflects the overall price levels, not actual lunch prices.
      </p>

      <p>
        The exchange rates of SDR (code XDR) is made from a fixed weight of exchange rates of five currencies,
        US Dollar, Euro, GB Pound, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan. Because Luncho is defined on SDR,
        it is not very dependent on the fluctuation of US dollar. The SDR and exchange rate data are
        updated at 00:06 UTC every day on the Luncho server.

      <h4>Limitations</h4>

        <li>
          Although you can expect to have simple lunch in restaurants for local residents with 100
          Luncho, restaurants for tourists must be much more expensive.
        </li>
        <li>There may be difference of price levels in a country. For example, it's cheap in rural while expensive in urban. The Luncho does not reflect such difference. You can see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HIRANO-Satoshi/luncho/blob/master/server/data/Data_Extract_From_ICP_2017_Metadata.csv">one of our data file got from the ICP web site</a> to know how the PPP data was acquired in each country.
