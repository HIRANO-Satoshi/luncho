      <h3 class=""> We overcome the inequality problem</h3>

      <p>
        Among many causes of the economic inequality problem, Luncho will contribute to overcome two major problems. One is the rapid progress of information technology (IT) that is promoting the gap between people who are utilizing IT and others. The other is decreasing labor's share.
      </p>

      <p>
        To solve to the IT gap, for example, anyone must have enough access to the latest IT services such as apps for commerce, productivity, life, and entertainment. However, people living in developping countries cannot buy digital services because of their high prices.
      </p>

      <p>
      Suppose you are selling your digital service for $7 per month per user. That price may be good for
      people living in advanced countries. But, how about for people in other countries? So many people
        might feel that $7 was too expensive.
      </p>

      <p>
        In that case you can sell your digital service at 100 Luncho per month at your web site, for example. Show one of the following examples to a visitor according to the location of the visitor. It shows both a Luncho price and its local price.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In USA</dt>
        <dd>Product A:  100 Luncho per month, $7.12 ($7.12 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In India</dt>
        <dd>Product A:  100 Luncho per month, 157.51 Rupee ($2.14 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Finland</dt>
        <dd>Product A:  100 Luncho per month, 6.08 Euro ($7.35 USD)</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        It seems your revenue will go down? Maybe NO, because people who couldn't buy your digital service
        would become to buy it. You can expect that accelerates growth of your user base and your revenue
        will be increased beyond the current revenue without Luncho.

      <h3> Who should use Luncho?</h3>

      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>Digital service providers</li>
        <li>Global companies that pay wages</li>
        <li>Donors</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>How it works?</h3>

      <p>
        Luncho is calculated using <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp">implied Purchase Power Parity (PPP) in the latest International Comparison Program (ICP)</a>, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR">IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDR)</a>, and the exchange rate of every currency.
      </p>

      <p>
        A PPP shows the price level in a country, that is, how much goods and services are in the
        country. The SDR is a mixture of major currencies including US Dollar, Euro, GB Pound, Japanese Yen,
        and Chinese Yuan. The SDR and exchange rates are updated at 00:06 UTC every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        100 Luncho is 5 SDR and it's converted into local currency using the PPP.
      </p>

      <p>
      The PPP is based on the latest International Comparison Program (ICP) lead by the World Bank. The
      ICP is tremendous effort done every five years by many people that investigates price levels of <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33623/9781464815300.pdf">many
        items such as bread, pork, cheese, sugar, gas, medical services, cars, etc. in all countries</a>. Luncho
      uses Actual Individual Consumption (AIC) per capita that represents statistical price levels in
        daily lives for wide applications, not actual lunch prices.
      </p>

      <p>
      Thus, with 100 Luncho in a country, you can expect to have simple lunch in a restaurant for local
        residents. Caution that restaurant for tourists should be much more expensive actually.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's similar to <a href="https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index">the famous Big Mac index</a>, but it considers much more factors and it's applicable to more things.
