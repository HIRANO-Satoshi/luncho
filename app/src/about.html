      <p>Luncho is a common value index that is similar to <a href="https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index" target="_blank">Big Mac index</a>, but is designed to be used widely for determining wages and the fees of digital services wages <b>for overcoming the inequality issue</b> in the world.</p>

      <p>Luncho is calculated every hour on <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp" target="_blank">implied PPP in the latest International Comparison Program (ICP)</a>, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR" target="_blank">SDR</a>, and exchange rates.</p>

      <p>The World Bank's ICP is tremendous effort by many people that investigates price levels of <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33623/9781464815300.pdf" target="_blank">many items such as bread, pork, cheese, sugar, gas, medical services, cars, etc. in all countries</a>. Luncho uses Actual Individual Consumption (AIC) per capita that represents statistical price levels in daily lives for wide application, not actual lunch prices. </p>

      <p>So, with 100 Luncho in a country, you can expect to have simple lunch in a restaurant for local residents. Restaurant for tourists should be much more expensive!</p>
