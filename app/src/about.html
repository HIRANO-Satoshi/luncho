      <h3> Who should use Luncho?</h3>

      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>Digital service providers for growth</li>
        <li>Global companies for paying wages</li>
        <li>Marketers for pricing and growth</li>

      <h3>Luncho shows the same value in any country
      </h3>

      <p>
        Luncho is a common value index among currencies. A luncho value shows the same value in any
      country respecting its price levels. For example, with 100 Luncho, you can have simple lunch
      in India, in Brazil, in USA, in Japan, and in any country.</p>

      <p>In India 100 Luncho is equivalent to 160 rupee ($2.19 US dollar), while the same 100 Luncho
      is equivalent to 17 real ($3.12 US dollar) in Brazil. In USA, 100 Luncho is about $7.21 US
      dollar. All are the same value because everything is just 100 Luncho.</p>

      <h3 class="">The inequality problem</h3>

      <p>
        Among many causes of the economic inequality problem, Luncho will contribute to overcome two major problems. One is the rapid progress of information technology (IT) that is enlarging the gap between people who are utilizing IT and others. People living in developing countries cannot buy advanced digital services because of their high prices. The other is decreasing worker's share.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Solution and an example of use</h3>

      <p>
        To solve to the IT gap, for example, anyone must have access to the latest IT services for
        commerce, productivity, life, entertainment and so on at affordable prices. We know people
        working on the IT services want to provide their services at appropriate prices in many
        countries, but we have not had a good measure to do so. That's the reason why we should use
        the common unit of pricing that has the same value in any country.
      </p>

      <p>Luncho is a common value index among currencies made for that. A luncho value shows the
        same value in any country respecting its price levels. It's fair and easy to understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose you are selling a digital service for $7 per month per user, that is good for people
        in advanced countries, but too expensive for people in other countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        In such case you can sell your product at 100 Luncho. Show one of the following examples to a visitor according to the location of the visitor. It shows a local price, the same 100 Luncho, and a price in US dollar.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>In USA</dt>
        <dd>Product A:  $7.12 per month, (100 Luncho)</dd>
        <dt>In India</dt>
        <dd>Product A:   157.51 rupee per month (100 Luncho, $2.14 USD)</dd>
        <dt>In Finland</dt>
        <dd>Product A:  â‚¬6.08 euro per month (100 Luncho, $7.35 USD)</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

      <h3> Your IT business will glow</h3>
      <p>
        If you use Luncho in your pricing page, people in developing countries who are not able to your
      digital service will become to buy it. Luncho accelerates growth of your user base and your revenue
        beyond the revenue without Luncho.
      </p>

      <h3>How it works?</h3>

      <b>100 Luncho is 5 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR">SDR (IMF's Special Drawing Rights)</a> and a Luncho value is calculated into a local currency using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity">implied Purchase Power Parity (PPP)</a> obtained from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp">the latest International Comparison Program (ICP)</a> and exchange rates.</b>

      <p>
        A PPP shows the price level in a country against another country, that is, how much goods
        and services are in the country. Our PPP data is based on the latest International
        Comparison Program (ICP) lead by the World Bank. The ICP is tremendous effort done every
        five years by many people that investigates price levels of <a target="_blank" href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33623/9781464815300.pdf">many
        items such as bread, pork, cheese, sugar, gas, medical services, cars, etc. in all countries</a>. Thus,
        Luncho reflects the overall price levels, not actual lunch prices.
      </p>

      <p>

        The SDR is a mixture of major currencies including US
        Dollar, Euro, GB Pound, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan. The SDR and exchange rate data are
        updated at 00:06 UTC every day.

      </p>

      <p>
        Caution that, although you can expect to have simple lunch in restaurants for local
        residents with 100 Luncho, restaurant for tourists should be much more expensive actually.
